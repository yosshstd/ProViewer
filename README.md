[![Open in Streamlit](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://your-app-name.streamlit.app/)

An interactive web application built with Streamlit for 3D protein structure visualization.

- **Predict protein structures** from amino acid sequences via the ESMFold API.
- **Visualize local structure files** (PDB or CIF) by uploading them.
- **Fetch structures directly** from the AlphaFold Database using a UniProt ID.

## üöÄ Features
The application features a clean, tab-based interface for three main functionalities:

- **üîÆ Predict**: Input an amino acid sequence to generate a 3D structure using ESMFold. The model's confidence score (average pLDDT) is also displayed.
- **üìÅ Upload**: Upload a `.pdb` or `.cif` file from your computer to view your own protein structures.
- **üì¶ AlphaFold DB**: Enter a UniProt accession ID to fetch and visualize the corresponding structure from the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database.
